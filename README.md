# COMPAS_Data_Display
A visual and interactive COMPAS dataset display showcasing the clear racial biases within the dataset.

Data is extracted from the original dataset and placed into a database, where everything is visualized in different categories. Inmates can be looked up based on their full name (shows a lack of privacy), and different filters can be added to observe different distributions.
